  <p>Empathic teaching is essential to good scholarship. Whether it is a conference presentation, reviewing an article, or giving a classroom lecture, academics are constantly engaging in the process of teaching in its many forms all of which require empathy to the recipient of either the critique or the praise. My teaching is generally informed by critical pedagogy, having engaged with Paulo Freire and bell hooksâ€™ work on teaching. However, I have found since the start of the pandemic a need for some forms of authority in the classroom to be essential to maintaining an effective learning environment. Critical pedagogical tools are better reserved for graduate instruction, as students gain confidence and earn the ability to engage in more autonomous self-instruction in the classroom. However, I still believe the best instructors guide student learning in a coherent way that leads toward clear outcomes and understandings in both undergraduate and graduate contexts. Often the worst kind of teaching will leave students ambivalent about where the teacher stands or where the arguments and theories of certain scholars lead to. That is not to say that I am overtly political in my teaching, on the contrary. Nevertheless, I do position social scientific thought within the context of its history and allow for students to judge positions based on their merits and strongest arguments. I advocate for the principle of charity to inform both student learning and my teaching.  My role is to engender critical thinking and best thinking practices. This means engaging with the strongest arguments possible for a position and presenting the most stinging critiques of these perspectives. I find this allows for students to grapple with multiple perspectives and paradigms and help to find and situate themselves within the context of social scientific thought writ large. Lastly, I know the value of student-centered learning. This is why I always mix my lectures with group assignments and group discussion throughout the lecture. I constantly encourage student questions and dialogue during lecture as well. I try to build at least 2-3 student activities or group discussions into each class period.</p>
