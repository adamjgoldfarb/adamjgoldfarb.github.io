  <p>I am an economic, cultural, and political sociologist and criminologist. 
I ask questions related to foundational concepts in these disciplines in two main overlapping areas. 
Both relate to the reproduction of inequality. 
1) I ask questions related to white-collar crime, corruption, and institutional failure. 
2) I ask questions related to masculinity, power, hegemony, and charismatic authority. 
Methodologically, I address these questions using primarily computational methods including statistics, social network analysis, and text analysis. 
I have training in comparative historical sociology and have experience developing and writing historical case studies to test sociological theory. 
I also have experience coding qualitative interviews. 
Thus, I consider myself a mixed methods researcher committed to epistemological and methodological pluralism. 
However, this is not a completely relativistic enterprise. Certain questions are better to ask than others. 
And based on the best questions we can ask, some methods are better equipped to provide those answers. 
This necessarily includes both qualitative and quantitative methods. 
The best sociologists need to have an open mind to the ever evolving landscape of methodological tools available to them, and I love to learn about those new tools.</p>
